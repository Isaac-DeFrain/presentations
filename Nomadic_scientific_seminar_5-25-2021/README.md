# TLA+ Formal Specification of Bootstrapping

You have arrived at the official presentation "slides"

## Instructions for use

The presentation starts with the `title.html` file

On that page, the TezEdge logo is a link to the intro page (`intro.html`)

On the intro page, there is a link at the bottom to the bootstrapping spec page (`bootstrapping_spec.html`)

The bootstrapping spec page has most of the info for the spec, but at the bottom, there is an interactive phase diagram

This diagram is a link to the same diagram (displayed in portrait, instead of landscape) as an svg file (`phase_diagram.svg`). Each node and transition label is a link to more info about that particular phase or transition in the specification. Each one of these pages links back to the phase diagram and also to the final page which contains several links.

I hope you enjoy! Thank you for your interest!
